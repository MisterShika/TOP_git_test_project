# TOP_git_test_project

This is a project from The Odin Project (TOP) to create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.

I used this project as a way to balance out my coding style from just using FP to being able to acclimate to OOP as well.

Simultaneously, I'm also using these exercises as a way to practice GIT and GIT best practices.
